I made this site for a tourism service.  

The site is viewable here: https://codedeki.github.io/Full-Stack-Shopping-Site-Front-End/.  

## Front-End Web Development using modern practices including:
* HTML
* SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets - CSS Compiler) 
* _New_ CSS  Features: 
  * Keyframes & Animations
  * Mixins
  * Responsive Media Queries
  * Variables
  * Browser Supports/Prefixes
  * Pop-ups using CSS alone!
  * CSS Grid
  * and more!
  
  




_Note: Some features are incomplete as this site was built for fun._  

An updated version of this project using NodeJS is viewable here:  
App:  https://adventure-tours-app.herokuapp.com/  (Please wait...! Free hosting on Heroku sometimes loads the app slower than usual)  
Code:  https://github.com/codedeki/Full-Stack-Shopping-Site-Back-End
