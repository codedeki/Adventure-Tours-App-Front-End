I made this site for a tourism service. Click the link here https://codedeki.github.io/Full-Stack-Shopping-Site-Front-End/ to see the site. Designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Front-End Web Development using modern practices including:
* HTML
* SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets - CSS Compiler) 
* _New_ CSS  Features: 
  * Keyframes & Animations
  * Mixins
  * Responsive Media Queries
  * Variables
  * Browser Supports/Prefixes
  * Pop-ups using CSS alone!
  * CSS Grid
  * and more!
  
  




_Note: Some features are incomplete as this site was built for fun._  

An updated version of this project using NodeJS is viewable here https://adventure-tours-app.herokuapp.com/
